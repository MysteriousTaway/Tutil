# TUTIL
Tutil stands for <b>T</b>away's <b>Util</b>ities. It is a wrapper/library that I use for making my projects.
Features are added if i'm using them often and i'm tired of always having to re-write them or i think that they will be useful later.
## Features
It's very well documented :D
- Runtime configuration
- Logging
- IO
  - File management
  - Directory management
  - JSON serialization and deserialization
- NET
  - Send a POST request to API
- TIME
  - Time formatting
  - Stopwatch
- SORTING
  - Bubble sort (integer only)
